### Assignment 2 tests

This directory contains tests and utilities for you to work on your
http server.

#### Utilities

This directory contains a single utility for you to use: `cse130_nc`.
This utility allows you to control the bytes that a client sends to
your server; it will help you with creating and testing invalid
commands.  The usage model is similar to the `nc` utility; see the
assignment document for details on how to use it.

#### Basic Tests

We released a few tests that mimic the examples found in your
assignment doc.  These cover basic functionality, but are no where
near thorough enough to evaluate whether your server works in a
majority of cases. We list what they do here:

* get_asmall.sh: sends a get request for a small file (the lyrics to
  Taylor Swift's Antihero).  Validates that the correct status code
  (200) and message body (the file contents) are returned by your
  server.

* put_new_asmall.sh: sends a put request for a small file that is new
  (i.e., there is no file at the URI specified in the put request).
  Validates that the correct status code (i.e., 201) and message body
  (Created\n) are returned in the response from your server.

* put_overwrite_asmall.sh: sends a put request for a small that is
  already contained in the server's directory (i.e., there is already
  a file at the URI specified in the put request).  Validates that the
  correct status code (200) and message body (OK\n) are returned by
  your server.

* iget_nofile.sh: sends a get request for a file that does not exist.
  Validates that the correct status code (404) and message body (Not
  Found\n) are returned by your server.

* invalid_version.sh: sends a request that has a malformed version
  (HTTP/1.10).  Validates that the correct status (400) code and message
  body (Bad Request\n) are returned by your server.
